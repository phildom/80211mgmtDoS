An implementation of the Deauthentication 802.11 DoS attack based
on the unprotected Management Frames.
This implementation is written for OpenBSD and BSD like systems. It
works as is on OpenBSD. Other BSDs and Mac OS X may need a few minor
adjustments.

With time I will add more information and other attacks.
I have already implemented the following attacks:
Association Request
Quiet
Channel Switch Announcement

Stay tuned.

Notes:
- You need to check the network memory.
  It depends, sometimes it completley fills up the memory.
  $ netstat -m

- The interface needs to be active. The best way to do this
  is by reseting the interface, e.g. on OpenBSD with:

# ifconfig ath0 -nwid -bssid -chan -wpa -nwkey media autoselect mediaopt monitor

  And then setting the interface into monitor mode on the channel
  or a channel nearby the AP's channel, e.g.:

# ifconfig ath0 chan 6 media autoselect mediaopt monitor
